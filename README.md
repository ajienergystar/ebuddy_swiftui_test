Personality & technical Questions
Please answer truthfully so that we can assign tasks accordingly to your workflow. There is no right and wrong answer for these.

1. What are the most difficult technical problems in your work experience you have encountered and how do you fix them?
   Answer :
   a. Concurrency Issues (Threading and Deadlocks)
      Solution:
      -Use DispatchQueue.main.async to ensure UI updates happen on the main thread.
      -Leverage tools like async/await for cleaner handling of asynchronous tasks.
      -Utilize proper synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores where necessary to prevent race conditions.
   
   b.Data Binding and State Management in SwiftUI
     Solution:
     -Use @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, and @StateObject appropriately to manage state across views.
     -Avoid overuse of @Binding in child views when the parent view is responsible for the state.
     -Ensure that state changes are handled in the correct order and context to avoid unexpected UI behavior.
     
   c.Complex Firebase Queries and Data Management
     Solution:
     -Break complex queries into smaller, manageable parts and execute them sequentially.
     -Use Firebase Firestore's built-in indexing to optimize query performance.
     -Implement pagination and batch fetching to avoid overloading the client with too much data at once.
     -For real-time updates, manage listeners carefully to avoid performance issues due to too many open connections.
